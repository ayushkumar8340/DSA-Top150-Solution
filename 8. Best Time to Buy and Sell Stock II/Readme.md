## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the *i-th* day.

On each day, you may decide to **buy** and/or **sell** the stock.  
You can only hold **at most one share** of the stock at any time.  
However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the same day, as long as you **never hold more than one share** at a time.

Return the **maximum profit** you can achieve.

## 💡 Example 1

**Input:**  
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
output = 7

Explanation: 
- Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5 - 1 = 4.

- Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 3 = 3.

- Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.
```

## Constraints

0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴
